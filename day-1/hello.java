//a pakage in java is used to group related classes,
//Think of it as a folder in which you can store related files. It helps to organize your code and avoid naming conflicts.  

public class hello {
 
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("90 days of code");
    }
}

//Naming Conventions in Java:
//1. Class Names: Class names should be in PascalCase, which means the first letter of
//   each word in the class name is capitalized. For example, MyClass, MyFirstClass.

//for functions and variables, the naming convention is camelCase, which means the first letter of the first word is lowercase,
// and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized. For example, myFunction, myVariable.

//PSVM is a default function in java which is the entry point of any java program. It stands for "public static void main". When you run a java program, the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) looks for this function to start executing the code.
// public is an Access Modifiers
// static is an keyword which helps us while coding to use the code without creating an object of a class.

// Basic Structure of the Java Prohgram:ṇ
// 1. Function: The main function is the entry point of the program where the execution starts.
// 2. Class: A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties and behaviors of the objects.

// Realtime example
// Class is HOUSEHOLD REPAIR
// Function is REPAIRING A LEAKY TAP
// function is PLumber
// function is Carpenter
// Function is Electrician
// function is Painter

// class is an entity where we are stroring all the functions or all teh functions are been accessed from the class.

// void defines that after execution of code its not give the default value as zero.( 0 )
